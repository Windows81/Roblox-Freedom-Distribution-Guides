Rōblox loads some assets from the internet. Many have numeric idens and can only be reached when you're authenticated on Roblox.com.

Let's download them.

What assets do we download? Let's find out.

Some files which contain important character scripts are encoded in `rbxm` files. But the `rbxm` format has built-in compression support. Oh. And most `rbxm` files in existence are pre-compressed. To decompress them, you can use RFD to modify them **in-place**:

```ps1
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.rbxm |% {
  RFD.exe serialise --method rbxl --load ($_.FullName) --save ($_.FullName)
}
```

Because the files are now decompressed, it's much easier to extract plaintext strings in `rbxm` files, just as it is for non-`rbxm` files.

```ps1
foreach ($p in ('player', 'server')) {
  foreach ($i in (348, 463)) {
    grep --only-matching --no-filename --perl-regexp "(?<=rbxassetid://)[0-9]\{6,\}" -R .\Roblox\v$i\$p\Content\ | Sort-Object -Unique > "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/$i-$p.txt"
  }
}
```

_Plenty._

Download the files (this command works only if you're before 2025-04-02):

````ps1
mkdir "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache"
cat "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/*.txt" | Sort-Object -Unique |% {
  $n = "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache/$_";
  if (-not (Test-Path $n -PathType Leaf)) { curl -L "https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset/?id=$_" --output $n }
}
```

You'll need to manually sift through to remove any rate-limited dumps.  Perhaps run the previous command line again.

```ps1
$bad = @(
  '{"errors":[{"code":429,"message":"Too many assets requested"}]}';
)
ls "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache2/" |% {
  if ($bad -contains (cat $_)) {rm $_ }
}
```


Rōblox will return _some_ (not all) file data as `gzip`-compressed. How about fixing that?

```ps1
Get-ChildItem "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache/*" |% {
  $n = $_.FullName
  if ((Get-Content $n -AsByteStream -TotalCount 2) -join ' ' -eq "31 139") {
    mv $n "$n.gz"
    gzip -d "$n.gz"
  }
}
````

But some of these files reference other files. Let's decompress them as well:

```ps1
Get-ChildItem "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache/*" |% {
  RFD.exe serialise --method rbxl --load ($_.FullName) --save ($_.FullName)
}
```

It's gonna take a while...

Then:

```
grep --only-matching --no-filename --perl-regexp "[1-9][0-9]\{6,15\}" --text -R "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache" | Sort-Object -Unique > "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache.txt"
```

Download the files (this command works only if you're before 2025-04-02):

```ps1
mkdir "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache2"
cat "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache.txt" | Sort-Object -Unique |% {
  $n = "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache2/$_";
  if (-not (Test-Path $n -PathType Leaf)) { curl -L "https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset/?id=$_" --output $n }
}
```

You'll need to manually sift through to remove any rate-limited dumps. Perhaps run the previous command line again.

```ps1
$bad = @(
  '{"errors":[{"code":429,"message":"Too many assets requested"}]}';
)
ls "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache2/" |% {
  if ($bad -contains (cat $_)) {rm $_ }
}
```

Not all the asset idens provided were valid. So once done, you'll also need to remove bad content files:

```ps1
$bad = @(
  '{"errors":[{"code":0,"message":"Request asset was not found"}]}';
  '{"errors":[{"code":0,"message":"User is not authorized to access Asset."}]}';
  '{"errors":[{"code":0,"message":"Asset is not approved for the requester"}]}';
)
ls "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache2/" |% {
  if ($bad -contains (cat $_)) {rm $_ }
}
```

```ps1
Get-ChildItem "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache2/*" |% {
  $n = $_.FullName
  if ((Get-Content $n -AsByteStream -TotalCount 2) -join ' ' -eq "31 139") {
    mv $n "$n.gz"
    gzip -d "$n.gz"
  }
}
```

```ps1
Get-ChildItem "./Guides/ExtractingRōbloxAssets/cache2/*" |% {
  RFD.exe serialise --method rbxl --load ($_.FullName) --save ($_.FullName)
}
