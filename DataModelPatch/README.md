# How I patched DataModelPatch for 2021E (v463)

I took the Rōblox client binary from [here](https://setup.rbxcdn.com/version-5a54208fe8e24e87-RobloxApp.zip).

I then did took the patches from [this guide](../Worships2021EGuide/README.md) and made a few more which weren't relevant to `DataModelPatch`.

Dum Rōblox decided that they won't load `./Content/models/DataModelPatch/DataModelPatch.rbxm` if it's been modified. Not to worry; I patched the signing requirement out.

Refer to [`DataModelPatchPatch.1337`](./DataModelPatchPatch.1337). Import it into **x32**dbg or something!

With those patches, I took out the SIGN chunk at the end -- and everything loaded fine. It took me 2 or 3 days to do.

No Python was needed. Just many tries, traces, and branch-changes in x32dbg.

And I'm not done yet...

## DataModelPatch Bytecode Analysis

### Preparation

1. Download [`DataModelPatch.rbxm`](DataModelPatch.rbxm). For Rōblox v463, `DataModelPatch.rbxm` can be pulled from:

```sh
curl -L "https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset/?id=5345954812&version=897"
```

2. Decompress the `lz4` chunks. I'd save them to a new file. The following Python code snippet requires a module Rōblox Freedom Distribution to be imported:

```py
from assets.serialisers import rbxl as parser
read_file_name = "./DataModelPatch.rbxm"
write_file_name = "./DataModelPatchDecompressed.rbxm"

read_data = open(read_file_name, 'rb').read()
write_data = parser.parse(read_data, methods={})
open(write_file_name, 'wb').write(write_data)
```

### Basic Metadata Collection (Script Names)

Open the newly decompressed file in a hex-editing tool. Write down the address of the byte highlighted below. The `0x01` right after `Name` corresponds to the `String` [property type](https://github.com/RobloxAPI/spec/blob/master/formats/rbxl.md#value-types). So we want to collect the byte right after this metadatum.

In this case, we're using `0x00094888` as the base address. The reason that these bytes follow as `0A 00 00 00` is because the `Connection` string afterwards is ten characters long.

And then:

```py
b = 0x00094888

b0 = b
head = b''
names = []
while True:
  head = write_data[b0:b0+4]
  if head == b'PROP':
   break
  l = int.from_bytes(head, 'little')
  e1 = b0 + 4
  e2 = b0 + 4 + l
  val = write_data[e1:e2]
  names.append((e1, e2, val))
  b0 += l + 4
```

That's just to get the names, which will be saved in the `names` list.

Now to get the values of the "Source" property.

### Bytecode Collection

Repeat for "Source". The 0x1D is _supposed_ to refer to the value type for [bytecode](https://github.com/strawbberrys/0x1D/tree/master/bytecode-poc).

![alt text](image-1.png)

```py
b = 0x000B5407

b0 = b
head = b''
sources = []
while True:
  head = write_data[b0:b0+4]
  if head == b'PROP':
   break
  l = int.from_bytes(head, 'little')
  e1 = b0 + 4
  e2 = b0 + 4 + l
  val = write_data[e1:e2]
  sources.append((e1, e2, val))
  b0 += l + 4
```

The bytecode dumps are saved in a list named `sources`.

### [`DataModelPatchBytecodes.zip`](DataModelPatchBytecodes.zip)

In the previous two sections, we collected `names` and `sources`. Time to save them to a file.

```py
for n,s in zip(names, sources):
 fn=(
  rb'%08x-%s'
  %(s[0], n[2].split(b'/')[-1])
 ).decode('utf-8')
 with open(fn, 'wb') as f:
  f.write(d[s[0]:s[1]])
```

Might be a match.
