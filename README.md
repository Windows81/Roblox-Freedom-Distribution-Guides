In keeping with the spirit of innovation, these guides should to allow other Rōblox researchers to replicate some of my work. I've incorporated their material into various aspects of Rōblox Freedom Distribution.

Though, the guides _don't yet_ allow you to reproduce _all_ the patches I made to the Rōblox clients from scratch.

**Don't overwhelm yourself spending too much dwelling on the material. Most of it is still poorly organised.**

**If you need any help, it'll save you time to contact VisualPlugin.**
